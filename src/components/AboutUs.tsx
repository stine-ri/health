          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            At Mental Health Chatbot, our vision is to create a world where mental health support is accessible
            to everyone, anywhere, at any time. We believe in breaking the stigma surrounding mental health
            and providing a safe space for individuals to seek help and guidance. Our aim is to empower
            individuals with tools and resources to manage their mental well-being effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            We envision a future where mental health care is as common and normalized as physical health care,
            making it easier for individuals to prioritize their mental health without fear or hesitation.
